            interface that can respond and interact with users. The layout is
            quite fluid with elements that shift and transform based on the
            user's input to create a sense of immersion. The use of color and
            motion effects draws user's attention to the key features, enhancing
            overall experience.

            poems easily, enhancing readability and engagement.

            take the center stage without any unnecessary distractions.

            users through the content. Each poem is paired with an audio player
            that activates when selected; providing a direct and intuitive audio
            experience.

            each poem. The interface is designed to be clean and contemplative
            to allow users to immerse themselves in the literary experience. The

            the poem and audio, guiding users to focus on the content rather
            than the interface. Besides, the consistent layout and predictable
            navigation establish a norm for how users can expect to interact
